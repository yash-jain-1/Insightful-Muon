Hello! I'm Yash Jain.

I am a creative, punctual, and goal-oriented individual with a high energy level, strong communication and organizational skills, and an eye for detail. My curiosity for how things work and drive to build scalable, meaningful tech products have guided my academic and professional journey.

I am currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in AI & ML at [Vellore Institute of Technology, AP](https://www.vitap.ac.in/) (2022â€“2026), maintaining a CGPA of [8.42](https://www.vitap.ac.in/).

Throughout my journey, Iâ€™ve interned at [Fidelity Investments](https://www.fidelity.com/) and [Mukham (Digital Fortress Pvt. Ltd.)](https://mukham.in), contributing to enterprise-grade CI/CD systems, DevOps pipelines, Flutter mobile applications, and scalable backend infrastructure using tools like Terraform, Kubernetes, Firebase, and gRPC.

I'm actively involved in communities like the [Open Source Club](https://www.oscvitap.org/) and the Machine Learning Club at VIT-AP. I have conducted seminars on Git/GitHub and hands-on workshops on artistic neural style transfer and GANs.

Beyond work, I love collaborating on impactful projects â€” from building cryptocurrency fraud detection tools to real-time food ordering platforms, Iâ€™ve embraced both frontend finesse and backend resilience.

Letâ€™s connect and build something awesome together ðŸš€
