Hey, Iâ€™m Yash Jain ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a tech enthusiast and builder pursuing B.Tech in CSE with AI & ML at [VIT-AP](https://www.vitap.ac.in/) (CGPA: 8.42). Iâ€™ve interned at Fidelity and Mukham, where I worked on CI/CD, Flutter apps, and DevOps with Terraform, Firebase & Kubernetes.
I contribute to the [Open Source Club](https://www.oscvitap.org/) and love building cool thingsâ€”from crypto fraud detection tools to food ordering apps. Always up for shipping clean code and solving real-world problems.
Letâ€™s connect and create something impactful ðŸš€
